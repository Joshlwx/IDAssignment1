# Features

First up, I would like to talk about my Homepage. It consist of 3 buttons for the users to click and they can also click the tabs on the top right corner if they prefer that instead. My homepage also showed a clear image of me and of course my affection for dogs. Next, I would like to talk about my resume. On the tabs, users can also go back to homepage or move on to the next section by clicking on the tabs that they prefer. It has a formal image of myself to look smart and neat. Next, users can look at my strengths to know what I am good at. As for experiences, users will know more about what I have experience before to get them have a rough understand on things that I have already learned. As for my educations, the users will know what are the educations that I have already completed as well as the courses that I am taking to know more about what I have already learned. As for my skills, users will have a clear image of what my skills set are and see if my skills set are up to my users standard. As for my hobbies, users will know about what kind of person that I will do during my free time. Next, I will talk about my blog. The users can look about the projects that I have completed during my diploma educations to let them know how well I have done it. Lastly, for my contact. Users can type in their name, email, mobile number and messages if they are interested on hiring me or giving feedbacks about my wepage.

# Existing Features

If users are interested on hiring me or giving feedbacks about my webpage, they can fill up their names, emails, numbers, and messages in the contact tab. There is also validations to guide my user on inputting it correctly.

# Testing

During my test, i encountered problems like images and stylesheet not appearing when going to a localhost. I realised that my pathing was wrong and therefore i encountered that problem. Also during my testing, after I finished inputting the informations on the contact page and pressed submit. There is no responds telling me that it has submitted succesfully. Therefore, i added my codings to fix that mistake. Also some of the sentences are very near to each others, I fixed it by seperating them into better sequence for the user to see properly and comfortably. When i was also doing the codings, i realised that some parts of my coding had missing code tags. It took me quite some time to slowly figuring out where is the missing code tag that I must place it in.
